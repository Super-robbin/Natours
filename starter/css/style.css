95vh - 95% of the

      rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8),
      rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)

    The image will be displayed below (behind) the gradient.

clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75%, 0 100%); - this will create a clip path that will cut the image in 4 specific points. 
The image will be displayed only in the area that is not cut by the clip path. Each of the 4 points is a coordinate (x, y) in the image. 
(0, 0) is the top left corner, (100%, 0) is the top right corner, (100%, 75vh) is the bottom right corner (we use vh so it adjusts dynamically when the page shrinks,
and (0, 100%) is the bottom left corner.
