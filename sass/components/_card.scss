    // 1 - To make the two sides one on top of the other, we need to use position: absolute; relative to the parent element.
    // 2 - We use top: 0; and left: 0; to make sure the sides are positioned at the top left corner of the parent element.
    // 3 - We also have to use width: 100% so that the sides are the same width as the parent element.
    // 4 - We use backface-visibility: hidden; to make sure the back side is not visible when the front side is visible.
    // 5 - IMPORTANT: Since we are using position: absolute, we have to specify the same height in the parent element as well.
    // It's because they are taken out of the natural flow. So, we took these cards out of their natural flow. And therefore the parent collapsed and lost its height.
    // 7 - We add border-radius and border-shadow to make the cards look better.
